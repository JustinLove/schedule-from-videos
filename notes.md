- Twitch recommends user friendly error handling

[10:54:27] <wtfblub> not a big issue but the extension "Dark Reader" breaks the loading of your schedule from videos


- window size not received on first load in iframe (twitch dev rig)
- exceptions (from elm?) on first load in iframe

- window size lag

- wiggly updates
- color coding game/topic? - data not available
- timezones?


## Extension rig

pwd developer-rig

`yarn host -d ../../../Documents/schedule-from-videos/public -p 8080 -l`
`yarn start -l ..\schedule-from-videos.json -c ../config.json`
